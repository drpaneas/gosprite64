🚀 Introducing GoSprite64: 2D Retro Game Development for Nintendo64 using Go! 🚀

## ✨ Features

> "You only need X and Y."

GoSprite64 embraces the flat world of tilemaps, palettes, and framebuffers — without the complexity of 3D pipelines.

* 🕹️ Built on [embedded-go](https://github.com/embeddedgo/go) to provide Go idiomatic experience.

* 🎮 Powered by [clktmr/n64](https://github.com/clktmr/n64) to make things possible directly on real N64 hardware.

* 🧠 Clean and idiomatic Go API inspired from [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/), [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)

* 💾 Runs on real N64 consoles (via [EverDrive](https://krikzz.com/our-products/cartridges/ed64x7.html) or [SummerCard64](https://summercart64.dev/))

* 🔧 Great for retro homebrew, demoscene, or nostalgic experiments
